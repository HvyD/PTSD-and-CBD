# PTSD-and-CBD

 #COMPARE AND CONTRAST PAPER IS THE MOST RECENT DRAFT. NEW MORE CURRENT CITATIONS.
These are papers I wrote over ten years ago and then recycled it for another class in 2011. In my studies, to figure out my own PTSD and other wartime brain damage I connected the dots of parts of th brain and CBD effects on repairing those structures. 

PTSD and alternative treatments like CBD
This is a repository of my two papers I wrote when I got out of the military and was trying to understand and cure my wartime brain damge of concussions and PTSD I had wrote about CDB as an alternative treatment over 10 years prior and now it seems to have an resurgences. At the time the topic was highly frowned upon even in academia and I was strongly suggested to do my report on another topic. I stood my ground and wrote the papers.
